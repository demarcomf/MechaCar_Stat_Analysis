## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Question 1: Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Answer 1: Vehicle length, ground clearance, and vehicle weight. All three of these had annotations(***) of their p-values being extremely small.

Question 2: Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Answer 2: No. Independent variables had significant impact on dependents, which impacted the overall slope.

Question 3: Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Answer 3: R-squared value: 0.7149. 71.5% prediction success would be considered effective.
